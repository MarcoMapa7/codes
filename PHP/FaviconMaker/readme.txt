PHP FAVICON MAKER is a package that allows the user to build his favicon on the fly
from any chosen  type of image file.Currently it allows to generate the favicon in the size
16*16,32*32,48*48 and also the html code to include in the page...The chosen file could even 
be an animated gif.In this case,I suggest to use firefox to really see the package generated 
code in action or any other browser which accept animated gif as favicon....
As the favicon doesn't need to be generated each time user launch a page, This package 
must be used offline except if a launch once system is implemented on every page...

The package use other package from the PHPCLASSES repository that are already included as:
