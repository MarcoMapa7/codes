MapBuilder:   https://www.phpclasses.org/package/7600-PHP-Display-maps-using-Google-Maps-API-v3.html and 

Very simple IP details :   https://www.phpclasses.org/package/10436-PHP-Get-IP-address-location-and-Google-Maps-image.html,

to find users location or specific IP location details and show the location on a google static or interactive map.
The package just act as the glue that join the three packages so user need to download them separately to know
more about all the available methods and how to optimally take advantage of the package.

Please ,be sure to be patient while example file is loading google interactive map because it takes some time.

Also be sure to let the browser development tools open to know the progress while testing.

Finally you may got an API KEY issue while testing on localhost be sure to test it in this case online or try to get your own
API KEY by following the directives in the main class source.
